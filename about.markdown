# About

The point of this site is to help align the efforts of researchers and the needs of Bitcoin protocol developers.
There are many unsolved problems that are impeding the progress of Bitcoin and "layer-2" protocols like the [Lightning Network].
Unfortunately, academic research departments are often unaware of them and end up working on less pressing topics.
It is then left to developers to refine solutions to these difficult problems while also engaging in day-to-day implementation.

Here we provide up-to-date list of research problems along with background and .
A compelling solution to any of these problems is likely to have a practical impact on the development of Bitcoin.

## Why Study Bitcoin

Bitcoin is the worlds largest cryptocurrency both by market capitalization and by users and **it is growing**.
Therefore, making a relatively small contribution to the development of Bitcoin is likely to have a much larger impact than work in other areas.
So far, a small group of researchers and developers have been responsible for most of the remarkable innovations that have got us to where we are today.
As the project has grown and expanded into development of its second layer the number of difficult theoretical and practical questions has grown tenfold.
There is a huge opportunity for committed researchers to contribute to its evolution.

## How you can help

This site is maintained by volunteers who hope to see Bitcoin flourish as a peer-to-peer permissionless and censorship resistant money.
Join us in adding new research topics and refining existing ones and, of course, proposing solutions to the problems.
